Write a program that sorts the arguments (numbers) from least value to greatest value.
You must write this program with the usort function.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
## HINTS

You can know if a number is smaller than another as following :
```php
if ($a < $b) {
    echo $number."$a is smaller than $b".
}
else {
    echo $number."$b is greater than $b".
}
```

To sort elements from an array, use usort.

Documentation on the `usort` can be found by pointing your browser here:
